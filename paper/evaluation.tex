\section{Measurement Setup}
\label{sec:measurement_setup}

To research the influence of different initial window size on TCP and the
network, we chose the network virtualisiation framework Mininet~\cite{mininet}.
Mininet exploits existing os virtualisation and ressource management features of
the linux kernel, namely Network namespaces~\cite{network_namespaces} and
Cgroups~\cite{cgroups}, to simulate multiple networks and peers on a single
host. Because no virtual machines are involved and Linux can make advantage of
zero-copy mechanism, the overhead of these Network namespaces is low.
Mininet also integrates other features such as traffic control and OpenFlow, so
one can build arbitrary network topologies and conditions. To create and
configure networks Mininet exposes a Python API and allow to interact with
network namespaces at runtime by giving shell access.
