\section{Measurement Setup}
\label{sec:measurement_setup}

To research the influence of different initial window size on TCP and the
network, we chose the network virtualisiation framework Mininet~\cite{mininet}.
Mininet exploits existing os virtualisation and ressource management features of
the linux kernel, namely Network namespaces~\cite{network_namespaces} and
Cgroups~\cite{cgroups}, to simulate multiple networks and peers on a single
host. Because no virtual machines are involved and linux can make advantage of
zero-copy mechanism, the overhead of these Network namespaces is low.
