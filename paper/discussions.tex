The result of this experiment shows possible gains by increasing the initial
congestion window for shorter bursty connection. However the topology selected
for testing is rather simple compared to the internet. It does not take
congested overloaded networks into account. High \emph{initcwnd} might hurt
network stability in this case, because congestion is perceived later.
In our network the bandwidth on all link was symmetric. Often client
networks are often asymmetric connected to the internet.
In case of downlink oriented traffic clients only need a fraction of uplink
speed to acknowledge packages. However in some cases if upload capacity is shared
with other flows, queues are filled up with and causes long delays. This phenomenon
is called buffer bloat~\cite{rfc970}. Longer congestion windows will have a
positive effect in case the downlink is not congested.
