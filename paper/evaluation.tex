\section{Measurement Setup}
\label{sec:measurement_setup}

To research the influence of different initial window size on TCP and the
network, we chose the network virtualization framework Mininet~\cite{mininet}.
Mininet exploits existing os virtualization and resource management features of
the Linux kernel, namely Network namespaces~\cite{network_namespaces} and
Cgroups~\cite{cgroups}, to simulate multiple networks and peers on a single
host. Because no virtual machines are involved and Linux can make advantage of
zero-copy mechanism, the overhead of these Network namespaces is low. It can
easily simulate 10GbE-Networks using commodity PC-Hardware. Mininet also
integrates other features such as traffic control and OpenFlow, so one can build
arbitrary network topologies and conditions. To create and configure networks
Mininet exposes a Python API and allow to interact with network namespaces at
runtime by giving shell access.
