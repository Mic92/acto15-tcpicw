\begin{abstract}
The initial congestion window is an important parameter of the TCP slow start
algorithm. It defines the upper limit of outstanding bytes a sender assumes at
the beginning of new connection.

The current standard RFC3390~\cite{rfc3390} from 2002 specifies a window of four
segments (over 4KB). Large-scale experiments~\cite{36640} by Google from 2010 have
shown that an increase to 10 segments improves the overall performance of web
servers without a negative impact on the network stability. Driven by these
results, the experimental standard RFC6928~\cite{rfc6928}
proposed an increase of the TCP's Initial Window.

In this paper the effect of different TCP's Initial Window on user latency is
evaluated in a controlled environment simulating various network condition with
the use of Mininet~\cite{mininet}.
